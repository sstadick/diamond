# Diamond

A Rust library to emulate the diamond operator in Perl / fileinput in Python.

## Prior Art

- fileinput, pythyon: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/fileinput.py
- diamond operator, perl: https://perlmaven.com/the-diamond-operator
- fileinput, rust: https://crates.io/crates/fileinput lacks reading from
  stdin
- grabinput, rust: https://crates.io/crates/grabinput not performant,
  not safe
